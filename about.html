            My journey began in Hong Kong, where I studied at Renaissance College of Hong Kong (RCHK), an international school. I was introduced to the pressures, stress, and anxiety students faced, both in local government schools and private schools, and experienced first hand the hostility and unhealth competition every student would face during their education. 
            From reading reports of student suicides to depriving myself of sleep, I had initially hated school and lost enjoyment in learning. It wasn't until I was given the opportunity to create a personal project, as part of my school curriculum, that I was introduced to TED Talks. I was inspired by the creativity, inspiration, and motivation speakers demonstrated,
            and felt the urge to bring that joyous environment into academia, and improve students' appreciation for learning in general. At the age of 14, I took on the daunting task of creating my own organization, which is now a 5-year-old project called VoiceUp. At the same time, I was curious as to how TED Talks would inspire people, which led me into the niche topic of
            "the psychology of inspiration". Through the different journal articles and research papers that I had read, I became enthralled in the idea of building upon existing research in this field, and eventually develop a working model of inspiration that can eventually be used to improve creativity, enhance innovation, and empower youths to find their passion. 
            Gradually, this interest developed into my long-term commitment towards psychology and my aspirations to be a researcher in the field.
            <br><br>
            During the summer after I had graduated from high school, I was foruntate enough to work at the Self-Regulation Laboratory in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I volunteered to be a data analyst and coder, synthesizing statistics for ongoing experiments investigating the impacts of materialism on social relationships, social relationships on emotion regulation, etc. It was my
            first experience in a university-level research environment, where I also got the chance to engage in heated discussions about recent academic publications, debates, and controversies in psychology. My role as a data-analyst, however, quickly changed, when I took initiative to design an Android App that would help the lab collect data for an ongoing study investigating
            the effects of self regulation on social media usage. I had no prior experience in the programming field, but had wanted to contribute more to the laboratory. Simultaneously, I was interested in recent app startups and challenged myself to learn programming over the summer. My ambitious goal of developing an app with no prior experience eventually led to my career as a co-author for this study.
            Currently, I am still providing assistance with pilot tests and debugging the app- we are looking to begin the offical study early next year.

                As I transitioned into UCLA, I decided to continue with my studies in both programming and psychology, with an aim to integrate my interests in creativity and inspiration into programming, specifically machine learning and artificial intelligence. I am currently a member of the Association for Computing Machinery at UCLA, particularly the ICPC Club, which specializes in algorithmic computation and problem solving;
                the AI Club, which specializes in machine learning using Tensorflow; and the Unity Club, which specializes in game design on Unity. I am currently using this knowledge to not only understand and read academic research into machine learning, but am also in the process of designing my own game using UnReal Engine 4.
                <br><br>
                Most recently, I was also accepted for a summer internship program at the Hong Kong Broadband Network: one of the leading telecommunication companies in Hong Kong supplying city-wide internet and mobile access. As a full-fledged IT Support intern, I was in charge of not only improving and debugging server-side features, but was also responsible for designing the front-end of a web-app that was used for the marketing committee to track customers and their 
                mobile plans. I also self-learned SQL and collaborated with other programmers in the department to improve database queries. I was also fortunate to attend workshops at JP Morgan, Microsoft, and Google, meeting with their staff, collaborating with their interns, and competing together in friendly business competitions. I experienced first-hand the importance of communication, taking initiative, and also merging business with programming on a corporate level.  
                <br><br> 
                Learning about computer science is not simply about programming. I have started to work on-campus as a part-time Computer Support Technician for UCLA Residential Life, managing student accounts, fixing computers, and troubleshooting printers around campus. My involvement not only with computer systems but also the maintenance of the college-wide servers has exposed me to the connections between software and hardware. 
                I am truly grateful for such an opportunity, and would not have truly appreciated computer science had I forgone this opportunity.
                <br><br>
                In integrating my experiences with machine learning, I have also started to work at a startup called Revree, which is designing an app that allows artists to design and create their custom Instagram and Snapchat filters. With my role as a computer vision trainee, I am involved in face landmark tracking and also integrating such mechanisms into mobile systems. Though the team is small, I have continued to take leadership by proactively discussing ideas with the team,
                proposing new methods and solutions for ongoing obstacles, and worked independently to learn about machine learning. Though I have not taken any official classes related to artificial intelligence, by searching YouTube video tutorials and online seminars, I have been able to work on par with graduate students and full-time programmers who have had years of experience in this field.
                <br><br>
                In addition, I have taken initiative to bring my experiences from VoiceUp to UCLA. I have formed a student organization under the name VoiceUp. With the referral and support by some faculty members, we have partnered with psychology research organizations such as MindWell UCLA and the Mindful Awareness Research Center (MARC), to craft events that can better educate and inform university students about psychology from a professional's viewpoint. 
                <br><br>
                As a researcher, I am continuing my studies into creativity by working with professors at the Tennenbaum Center for the Biology of Creativity. I am currently designing studies to evaluate the factors that enhance creativity, as a means of designing a Creativity Training Program that can enhance individual creativity. Though this is a long term project, it is one step closer towards understanding the psychology of inspiration, and I am truly excited for what's to come.

                If anybody told me 10 years ago that I would be studying psychology, I would have laughed it off. I had always thought that I would be a doctor, lawyer, or neurosurgeon, slaving away at my job to make my parents proud and living with financial stability. I thought that I would be attending a university in Hong Kong or in the United Kingdom, following my parents' expectations and making them proud. To this day, I do not regret the choice I had made to switch to psychology,
                to convince my parents that I would succeed in the new yet growing tech industry. I am forever amazed by the confidence and ambitions I have to take on such big projects, even if I do not feel I am qualified for it. I chose to live a life without regrets, and I am certain that I will continue to do so for years to come.

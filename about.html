        <p class="overview">
            My journey began in Hong Kong, where I studied at Renaissance College of Hong Kong (RCHK), an international school. I was introduced to the pressures, stress, and anxiety students faced, both in local government schools and private schools, and experienced first hand the hostility and unhealth competition every student would face during their education. 
            From reading reports of student suicides to depriving myself of sleep, I had initially hated school and lost enjoyment in learning. It wasn't until I was given the opportunity to create a personal project, as part of my school curriculum, that I was introduced to TED Talks. I was inspired by the creativity, inspiration, and motivation speakers demonstrated,
            and felt the urge to bring that joyous environment into academia, and improve students' appreciation for learning in general. At the age of 14, I took on the daunting task of creating my own organization, which is now a 5-year-old project called VoiceUp. At the same time, I was curious as to how TED Talks would inspire people, which led me into the niche topic of
            "the psychology of inspiration". Through the different journal articles and research papers that I had read, I became enthralled in the idea of building upon existing research in this field, and eventually develop a working model of inspiration that can eventually be used to improve creativity, enhance innovation, and empower youths to find their passion. 
            Gradually, this interest developed into my long-term commitment towards psychology and my aspirations to be a researcher in the field.
            <br><br>
            During the summer after I had graduated from high school, I was foruntate enough to work at the Self-Regulation Laboratory in the Chinese University of Hong Kong. I volunteered to be a data analyst and coder, synthesizing statistics for ongoing experiments investigating the impacts of materialism on social relationships, social relationships on emotion regulation, etc. It was my
            first experience in a university-level research environment, where I also got the chance to engage in heated discussions about recent academic publications, debates, and controversies in psychology. My role as a data-analyst, however, quickly changed, when I took initiative to design an Android App that would help the lab collect data for an ongoing study investigating
            the effects of self regulation on social media usage. I had no prior experience in the programming field, but had wanted to contribute more to the laboratory. Simultaneously, I was interested in recent app startups and challenged myself to learn programming over the summer. My ambitious goal of developing an app with no prior experience eventually led to my career as a co-author for this study.
            Currently, I am still providing assistance with pilot tests and debugging the app- we are looking to begin the offical study early next year.

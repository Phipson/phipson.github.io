            <b>3D Printing for Everyone (abbreviated as 3D4E) is an intercollegiate 3D printing engineering society</b>. Joining 3D4E as a general member of the UCLA Chapter in 2017, I was inspired by the passion, vision, and enthusiasm the board members had towards 3D printing, which motivated me to drive their vision forward.
            <br><br>
            In particular, with a self-taught web development background, <b>I wanted to rebrand 3D4E and establish a clear image for the organization as both a professional engineering organization with a fun, approachable atmosphere</b>. In the process, I became the webmaster of the organization and rebuilt the club's website to reflect this club identity.

          <!-- TODO: Past images -->
          <p>
            There were several glaring issues with the previous iterations of the website, as follows:
            <br><br>
            1. On both a computer or mobile device, the <b>website was not responsive and relied on a hamburger menu to collapse and expand the navigation features</b>. Although this alleviated issues surrounding portability across devices with different screen sizes, it did not maximize the potential of navigation on a large monitor screen, because the navigation menu is hidden.
            <br><br>
            2. The website's background, which displayed UCLA's campus, <b>did not clearly reflect its identity as a 3D printing society</b>. The home page only had 4 different 3D printing models, which did not reflect the extensive models and projects the team had made in the past.
            <br><br>
            3. The website <b>did not explicitly communicate the expertise, history, or infrastructure of the club</b>. Interested students had no idea how to join, what events were involved in 3D Printing, or what the club does in general.
            <br><br>
            4. The <b>lack of social media links on the website</b> made it difficult for users to find the club's Facebook page, or contact them through email.
            <br><br>
            5. The <b>sections in the website is also misleading</b>: rather than putting the projects and primary vision of the club at the beginning of the home page, the website emphasizes the club background and board members at the top. This reduces the significance of the club projects, which forms the core of the club.

            <br>
            <p>
              With the new website, I wanted to present 3D4E as a multifaceted, impassioned organization that is both professional and fun. To do so, I did not want to limit myself to 1 single color scheme: I wanted to tell a story through the website by showing different snapshots of the organization and reflect that through both the colors and the sections in the website. Addressing the previous issues mentioned above:
              <br><br>
              1. The menu is displayed at the top of the website for widescreen devices, and collapses into a hamburger menu for mobile devices.
              <br><br>
              2. The website's mission statement is placed at the top of the home page. The projects and workshops are placed at a higher priority in the home page, followed by the board members and social activities.
              <br><br>
              3. Social media outlets are accessible on the menu.
              <br><br>
              4. Color schemes of the website change as users move between sections, each representing a different aspect of the club. The colors represents the multifaceted nature of the club, and the diverse experiences and opportunities available.

              5. Particularly with the projects section, I learned how to animate SVGs using Javascript, and generated 2D animations to illustrate the core projects that have been built in this club. These animations are aimed at users who may not want to read about each project in detail, but simply want a high-level overview of the work we do.

            <br>
            <p>
              To offer users the ability to purchase custom-made 3D prints for future fundraisers and club activities, I also developed an online shop for our club. In order to maintain the same design and functionality as our original website, I decided to use Snipcart, which offerred a backend API and front-end workflow for users to make secure online purchases through a static web-page. 
              <br><br>
              To create this site, I referenced the following eShop interfaces and designs:
              Nike, Adidas
              <br><br>
              From these websites, I made the following observations:
              <br>
              1. Designs typically emphasized product images over textual descriptions
              <br>
              2. A shopping cart was visible throughout the website so end-users could easily navigate and refer to their cart.
              <br>
              3. Color schemes were clean and simple to complement the diverse array of images and products
              <br>
              4. Any textual elements were concise and emphasized to add contextual elements to the products introduced.

              <h5 class="ProjectSectionHeader">Defining a Transaction Workflow</h5>
              <br>
              <p>
                Unlike most traditional eShops, however, as our club was only using an online store for fundraisers, we realized that a database would be required to store and manage all available products. Furthermore, transactions must be made reliably through available payment gateways.
                <br><br>
                To circumvent the payment issues, we decided to use PayPal's developer API. The reason for doing so was that PayPal only took a flat percent of each transaction for each purchase: this meant that we would not be required to pay a monthly subscription to use their service, which was predominant in other APIs such as BrainTree, Stripe, etc. Additionally, PayPal already offered HTML code for adding PayPal buttons to existing websites, so there was little need to create an entire front-end interface from scratch.
                <br><br>
                To make our website scalable, we also used Google's Firebase Storage and Real-Time Database for managing all user transactions. The reason for doing so is to avoid hard-coding all possible products. Additionally, because the underlying logic for making purchases is similar, a database would streamline the process of making transactions.
                <br><br>
                Combining these ideas, I have created the following eShop as shown in the video below.

        <div id="anchor-proj-use-cases" class="SubSection">
            <!-- TODO: Screenshots and videos -->
            <h5 class="ProjectSectionHeader">Ongoing Development</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              Currently, I am improving website navigation so that it is <b>responsive for mobile devices of different dimensions</b>. A piloted version of the eShop has been deployed, and we are currently running preliminary user tests to examine the user experience of purchasing products and how effectively we can keep track of all purchases.

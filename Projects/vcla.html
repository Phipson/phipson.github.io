            <p>
              As a volunteer for the VCLA Lab, I primarily assisted with 2 ongoing projects on a volunteer basis outside of classes: VRKitchen, which is a virtual environment for end users to collaborate with virtual intelligent agents; and a Physics Simulation Environment, used to track and test object stability given different hand poses.
              <br><br>
              Project details can be found on the lab website here.

          <br>
          <p>
            In VRKitchen, my primary responsibility was designing kitchen training tasks that end-users could collaboratively perform with a virtual agent, specifically in a kitchen environment. In particular, I helped design and create a design workflow for users assembling a wooden table with a VR agent, and cracking an egg as part of an extended food cooking scenario. Additionally, I also assisted the group with modeling and extracting meshes for creating a series of procedurally generated kitchen environments for training the system. These models were originally retrieved from an online database generated by Princeton University, but did not contain any functional components to the kitchen furniture. Hence, I was responsible for classifying and deconstructing these models for training the agent.
            <br><br>
            In the process of working on this project, I gained more experience and familiarity with the Unreal Engine 4 Game Engine, and how to design logic and interactive VR Scenes.
            <br><br>
            I am currently assisting the group by expanding upon their existing Image Quality Assessment dataset, used to enhance the fluency and robustness of the training and testing data used to train virtual agents.

            <p>
              For this research project, I assisted in designing a customized method of generating different hand poses and resulting meshes in the Bullet Physics Engine, which was used to test and debug whether certain objects would be stable when held by a specified hand poses.
              <br><br>
              As part of this research, I programmed and configured the existing Bullet Physics environment to suit the required research needs. Additionally, to streamline the computation process, I also designed a command line method that could be used to call and configure the environment to automate the testing process given a numpy file containing data for both the object and the hand poses.

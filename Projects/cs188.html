              As part of an undergraduate course on scalable internet services at UCLA, I worked in a group of 3 to create a internet service that was deployed on Amazon Web Services this quarter. The group project was done following Agile Software Development paradigms, and we had weekly sprints to create this service from start to finish. For this project, there were no project manager or scrum master, so we were all held accountable for our own portion of the project.
              <br><br>
              As a team of 3, we created an internet service called LinkIn, which is a social media application for gamers to connect, host LAN events, and socialize through their favorite console or online games. Borrowing the idea of using Tinder, gamers can now connect and socialize using a card interface where they can select players through swiping on their device, or liking a user profile on a computer or laptop.

              Currently, I am in the process of developing an online store for users to purchase 3D-printed merchandise that we design, which we use for our fundraisers to fund our annual spring showcase and other 3D printing events. I am also improving website navigation so that it is more responsive for other mobile devices.

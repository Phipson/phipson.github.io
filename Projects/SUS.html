              As part of LA Hacks 2017, the annual hackathon in Los Angeles, California, I worked with a team of 4 to prototype an Android application called SUS, used to <b>track and visualize pollution in the Los Angeles area, while also giving end-users the opportunity of reporting pollution, and creating events to address these issues</b>. SUS, a play on words of "SOS" and "Sustainability", was <b>awarded the Most Sustainable Hack of 2017</b>.

              Due to time constraints, we were tasked to directly implement and prototype our desired design. However, in the process, we also shared and showcased some of the following mockups. The final code for our project is as shown in <a class="projectlink" href="https://github.com/Phipson/SUS">this repository</a>.

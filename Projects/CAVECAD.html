            <p><b>Commercial CAD Software offer limited opportunities for end users to design products collaboratively.</b> To design 3D objects using a 2D user interface, users typically have to surmount a steep learning curve, and then design using nonintuitive modes of input dissimilar to conventional design interactions involving pencil and paper. Additionally, <b>commercial CAD Software offer little physical reference points</b>: to prototype and evaluate the functionality of their models, users would have to manufacture their designs, perform tests, and modify their designs thereafter. This poses a bottleneck in the CADCAM workflow, especially in furniture design, where <b>designers have to work with clients to create aesthetically pleasing, functional, and ergonomically friendly products</b>.
            <br><br>
            <b>Advancements in VR and mobile AR addresses some of these challenges</b>, by utilizing expressive modes of input such as 3D hand gestures, and introducing 3D virtual environments scaled to real world dimensions. To overcome the challenges of collaborative CAD, <b>we introduce a Collaborative Augmented and Virtual Environment for Computer-Aided Design (CAVECAD)</b>, which is a CAD tool that offers a collaborative design environment in VR and mobile AR, for end users to design fabricable flat-pack furniture collaboratively or independently, in the same or remote environments, simultaneously or at different points in time.
            <br><br>
            For this research project, I also drafted a <a class="projectlink" href="https://bit.ly/30NVwQx">project proposal</a>, which examines existing research and literature around CAD in AR and VR.

            <h5 class="ProjectSectionHeader">Creating a Design API</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              As part of our project, we collaborated with the <a href="https://uclalemur.com/" class="projectlink">UCLA Lab for Embedded Machines and Ubiquitous Robots</a> and used their backend system to procedurally create fabricable flat-pack furniture. In order to interact with their backend, I designed and created a customized Unity API that connected to the backend server, and, given a set of parameters, generated a desired furniture as supported by the system. The resulting furniture was sent back through the network into our Unity server, parsed as an STL file, which was rendered and displayed in our game engine.
              <br>
              <br>
              To ensure that the interface would work with either AR or VR environment, I also worked with members in my research team to generalize our API such that it was hardware independent. To further conceal the underlying complexity of the system, we further packaged the system as a set of scripts, so users could easily generate, remove, and modify their furnitures using simple function calls.
              <br><br>
              Code for the API can be found in <a class="projectlink" href="https://github.com/Phipson/FARVR">this Github repository</a>.

            <h5 class="ProjectSectionHeader">Integrating API into AR and VR</h5>
            <br>
            <p>
              With two Nokia smartphones and an HTC Vive available, I separated the project into two separate concurrent sub-tasks. The first task involved integrating the API into the VR environment using the HTC Vive. The second involved doing so in the AR environment, using the Nokia smartphones. Both environments were designed on Unity, to ensure that the code could be used and targeted for devices outside of our existing VR and AR systems, and to streamline the code with the API.
              <br><br>
              To interact with our API in respective 3D environments, we defined a unified gesture library that allowed users to interact uniformly with the furniture using both a 2D touchscreen (as with mobile AR), and 3D hand gestures (as with VR). For 3D hand gestures, we used the Hi5 VR Gloves to track hand poses and gestures. Whereas my colleagues were responsible for the VR interface, I was responsible for the mobile AR API.
              <br>
              <br>
              To ensure a streamlined method of interacting and collaborating between AR and VR environments, we defined a <a class="projectlink" href="https://bit.ly/2VjehKE">unified gesture library</a> that would utilize the different modes of input in both AR and VR environments, thereby making our interface more accessible regardless of the hardware that is used.
              <br></br>
              The mobile AR environment could be divided into two stages. First, I had to design a 2D User Interface for designing and creating furniture. Secondly, I had to map detected gestures with the furniture-specific parameters. After several iterations, I designed the following interface, annotated below.

              To connect the two systems together, we used Unity's Photon Networking Library, which was a free plugin for networking multiplayer games. To network between our AR and VR interface, we updated our API to support shared furniture design capabilities, and as a result, created the following possible design workflows between users.

            The study required users to participate in pairs. Users were asked to perform 3 separate design tasks, each of which lasting between 15 to 20 minutes.
            <br><br>
            <b>TASK 1:</b> Participants designed 1 specified furniture with required parameters in the VR Environment.
            <br>
            <b>TASK 2:</b> Participants designed 1 specified furniture with required parameters in the AR Environment.
            <br>
            <b>TASK 3:</b> Participants designed 1 specified furniture in collaboration with another participant, one using AR and one using VR.
            <br>
            <b>TASK 4:</b> Same as task 3, but the devices were swtiched.
            <br><br>
            The furniture in each of the 4 tasks were different. However, among groups, each participant designed the same furnitures.

              All data was collected through questionnaires, which contained quantitative and qualitative measures for evaluating CAVECAD's ease of use, interactability, and efficiency when designing furniture in different scenarios. Additionally, subsequent videoed interviews were used to collect further verbal feedback from users.
              <br><br>
              The data was then analyzed using a recursive method akin to the Infinity Squares, where observations were iteratively categorized into common observed themes across all participants. A detailed analysis can be found in my <a class="projectlink" href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/spqhkvmrmhtq">research paper</a>.

              This research opportunity was definitely a rewarding experience, particularly as I had no prior research background or prior knowledge in AR or VR. Upon entering this lab and leading this research project, I gained hands-on experience throughout all aspects of the research process, which inspired me to further pursue and understand the world of AR and VR.

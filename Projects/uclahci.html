              In addition to CAVECAD, which was a project I led as a collaborative research initiative with the UCLA Robotics Lab, I also worked at the UCLA HCI Lab on a volunteer basis outside of class. In particular, during the Spring of 2019, I participated in a research project called Geno, which was a web application designed for developers to embed voice input into preexisting applications.

          <br>
          <p>
            For this research project, I helped design and execute a formative user study to investigate the challenges end users have when designing and integrating voice input into web applications using existing software. Additionally, I also prototyped and designed different interfaces and programming workflows users could use for programming voice input into their system.

            The main motivation of creating this interface was to treat programming voice input as a method of logical programming. End users who may not be familiar with how voice input works should get an understanding of the causal relationships between their input and data with the possible functions and output that the voice input can be mapped to. One of the challenges with embedding voice is the lack of prior knowledge about how the API works in code, and the need to learn the library before integrating it. With this interface design, I aimed to provide a visual representation of the voice input that would abstract the underlying complexity of the code, thus streamlining the embedding process regardless of the library that is used.
            <br><br>
            Upon conducting the user research, I gathered and synthesized the data using an iterative process akin to Infinity Squares, where recurring themes in the data, supported by both qualitative and quantitative evidence, were recursively filtered. Finally, using this evidence, I then proceeded to write a report documenting the research and results I collected.

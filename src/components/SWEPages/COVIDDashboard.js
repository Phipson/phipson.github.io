                        Machine learning models are typically complex and challenging to interpret, especially for designers and stakeholders with little programming or machine learning experience. The introduction of interpretable machine learning algorithms have made it possible to understand what data the algorithm is using to make predictions, how features are weighted, and communicate it in a meaningful way to non-programmers. This is particularly an issue with COVID, where local and international travelers want to assess where to travel based on COVID cases and deaths. I decided to build a dashboard that would use machine learning to predict the COVID cases across different states in America for the day after the dashboard was accessed. Through a combination of data visualization and interpretability features, the goal of this dashboard was to help users identify trends in COVID cases that can help them plan potential travel plans, while also offering explanations that can aid their understanding of how the algorithm is making these predictions.

                    When examining a user-centered dashboard that would help travelers plan their trips, my initial focus was on map displays, which would sort data based on geographical location. To help users focus on states of interest, I added interactions for users to zoom in on specific geographic regions by clicking on the state of interest, causing the dashboard to display state-specific data. This was later actualized using ReactJS, which had a combination of free open-source dashbaord templates like Google Material UI's dashboard template; and free libraries for developing interactive charts and maps using D3.js and React Simple Maps.

                        To integrate my design with the machine learning algorithm, I had to consider how to query from the trained model and update the view. To do so, I used ReactJS and its Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, which allowed me to manage the underlying data as states that can be rendered onto graphs. I then ran the model on a Python Flask server, which the ReactJS app would query to fetch a prediction based on an array of COVID Cases for the past 3 consecutive days.

                    To make this model interpretable, I used LIME, which is a surrogate model that interprets a given model by describing features and inputs from the dataset that is weighted more importantly in the neural network. This data can be visualized and communicated in textual form, helping users understand how the model made a certain forecast.
